        <p>A computer program must be used to generate all the potential rules and obtain
their levels of accuracy. It seems clear that only decision rules with 100%
accuracy should be used to form new decision rules, but lower level accuracy
of potential rules is a challenge to proceed with the data-mining process. In this
example, due to the small size of the dataset, it is difficult to generate a new
decision rule with 100% accuracy. However in the Weather Problem data set
presented by Witten and Frank (2000), it is possible to find 58 association
rules with 100% accuracy.</p>

(Knowledge Data Discovery system ) are presented in Table 12.5 ( Turban &

        <h4><b>Case – Using the DSS Forecasting Software Package</b></h4>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Sam Fordson, president of AAA Corporation was meeting with George
Springfield, vice president of operations, to discuss the upcoming budgeting
cycle. George said, “Sam, I’m tired of operations being forced to change
forecast every month. Every fall just before budgeting time, the marketing
people make their annual sales forecast, which, as you know, is updated
monthly. I can tell you that this forecast is merely a composite of all the ‘wish
list’ submitted by the marketing people. After the marketing vice president
receives these forecasts, he simply adds them and adjusts the results to the
situation. I think these procedures for forecasting are too crude, and something
must be done about them.”<br>
Sam replied, “Well George, as you know, the market is very dynamic in our
business and the marketing vice president tries to stay in close touch with the
market. But if you have a better approach to forecasting our monthly demand,
we’ll be happy to give it try.”<br>
George reminded him that the Information Technology people recommend
strongly the use software packages of the corporation’s DSS. The use of the
packages can be made at no additional cost and providing immediate response
to standard questions formulated through the SQL (Structured Query Language) available in the DSS. Forecasting Package and Statistical Analysis
Package are the two most common packages used in business decisions.
George continued, “Perhaps we should test these packages to assist us in
planning the short-term and annual budgets.”<br>
At this point, Peter Song, the marketing vice-president, walked into the office,
and Sam and George explained the entire situation to him. Peter said, “I’m very
skeptical that a computer can be used to replace the marketing judgment that
we’ve spent years developing. How can computer methods do efficient
demand forecasting when so many factors are involved?”<br>George reminded him that the IT people had warned that the forecasting
package is formed by different quantitative and qualitative methods, and the
selection of the most appropriate method or combination of methods, besides
the technical or mathematical problems involved, requires decisions involving
the interest of more than one manager.

        <p>George and Peter agreed to develop a forecasting model using all available
historical data except those for the past year. This model would then be used
to forecast demand for the past year, and the results would be compared to
actual demand. All three managers agreed to meet again when the model was
complete to review the results of the test and only then decide to use the results
of the forecast for the short-term and annual budget planning.

        <center><h3><b>Conclusions</b></h3></center>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>The search for new knowledge, inside and outside the organization, exploring
databases, reports, organizational history, patents, professional experience,
etc., is part of the search for organization knowledge. The search for organizational knowledge depends on the availability of an efficient computer system.<br>
An organization’s strategic planning is traditionally based mostly on market
analysis and financial planning. Factors such as indirect costs, customer
satisfaction or preference, usually are not considered in the organization’s
decision strategy due to the difficulty to determine the appropriate information
indicator and range. New software technologies such as the<b>Decision Support
            Systems</b>(DSS) and<b> Knowledge Data Discovery </b>(KDD) have been developed as an effort to obtain new knowledge to support decisions in the
organization.<br>
The DSS is an important support for strategic decision making, through
sensibility analysis, known as “what – if?” questions, which allow the examination of new decision alternatives.<br>
Data-mining techniques used inside the KDD environment utilize traditional
statistical and operations research techniques to extract new knowledge, and
new techniques such as Market Basket Analysis to discover new decision rules.
The use of advanced software technologies such as DSS or KDD should
provide important advances in the strategic decision making in the organization.</p>
